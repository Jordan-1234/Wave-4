#Write a function named reverseLookup that finds all of the keys in a dictionary
#that map to a specific value. The function will take the dictionary and the value to
#search for as its only parameters. It will return a (possibly empty) list of keys from
#the dictionary that map to the provided value.
#Your program should create a dictionary and then
#show that the reverseLookup function works correctly when it returns multiple
#keys, a single key, and no keys.
